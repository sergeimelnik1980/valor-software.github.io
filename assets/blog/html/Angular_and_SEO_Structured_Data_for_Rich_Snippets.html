<div class="max-w-full"><p>One of SPA's (single page application) issues is poor indexing in search engines and
    search optimization in general. Specifically, because Ð¡lient-side rendering typical for JavaScript SPAs isn't
    optimal for SEO. Indexing crawlers may not always run the JavaScript code so the content may remain ignored. That
    is why you should implement <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#server-rendering"
            data-rt-link-type="external">SSR (server-side rendering)</a> to render the content on the server rather
    than on the client side, thus, help the crawlers index it.&nbsp <br></p>
    <p>Another part of SEO activities for
        web application development that can be managed by the programmer is improving the site info appearance in
        Google
        search results so it catches the eye. Structured info blocks draw the user's attention better than an unordered
        piece of text. Google provides a set of rules on creating neat text snippets<em> - </em>this is what we'll talk
        about in this article.<br></p>
    <p>As you might notice, we at Valor Software love Angular ), not to mention that
        it's one of the three most popular JavaScript frameworks. In this article, we're going to mimic building an
        Angular app template, so be ready to dive into some code examples.<br></p>
    <p>Let's get to the point and
        introduce you to the Structured data world :)&nbsp </p>
    <h2>What is Structured data?<br></h2>
    <p>Structured data
        is a format for presenting data suggested by <a href="https://schema.org/" data-rt-link-type="external">schema.org</a>
        standards. When you create app components using a Structured data format, you'll be able to customize the search
        results view. The search robots parse the structured data and show your site in a more detailed and organized
        view, as <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery"
                    data-rt-link-type="external">rich snippets (also known as rich results)</a>. Also, the more
        organized
        the data structure is (in this context, according to the Structured data principles), the better your chances
        are
        to improve your rankings.<br></p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using Structured data is an additional instrument to
        create an SEO-friendly app, while applying standard SEO features like meta descriptions or title tags is still
        crucial.&nbsp <br></p>

        <figcaption><em>Examples of rich snippets - you'll find the one to present your specific content.</em><br>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Google Search supports three formats of Structured data (<a href="https://json-ld.org/"
                                                                   data-rt-link-type="external">JSON-LD</a>,
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/" data-rt-link-type="external">Microdata</a>, <a
                href="https://rdfa.info/" data-rt-link-type="external">RDFa</a>), but recommends using JSON-LD.
        Moreover, this format suits SPA development the best since Google can read JSON-LD data when it's dynamically
        injected into the page's contents, particularly by JavaScript. While Microdata and RDFa make use of
        characteristic HTML tag attributes.</p>
    <h2>How to use Structured data?</h2>
    <h3>Preliminary work</h3>
    <p>
        While the crawlers are unfriendly to dynamic content and SPAs are dynamically generated by JavaScript on the
        fly, SEO for SPAs seems to be an issue. However, we have an SSR to assist us. With the help of SSR, web
        crawlers get not only an index.html file with the app-root component but a pre-generated HTML page with the
        entire component delivered by the SSR mechanism.<br></p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>The solution
        (specifically, code examples) we describe in this article won't work if SSR isn't going to be set up for your
        project. In the case of Angular applications as a topic of this article, we recommend that you build the
        server-side rendering part using the most popular SSR technology for Angular - <a
                href="https://angular.io/guide/universal" data-rt-link-type="external">Universal</a>.&nbsp </p>
    <h3>Adding
        JSON-LD format<br></h3>
    <p>To use JSON-LD format in your code, you'll usually add a &lt script&gt tag in the
        page head or body. However, since Angular removes any &lt script&gt tags from templates, you'll need to
        utilize DOMSanitizer service. You'll notice how &lt script type="application/ld+json"&gt is interpreted via
        getSafeHTML in our example of injecting JSON-LD as a component:<br></p>
    <pre>
import &#123; Component, OnInit &#125; from '@angular/core';
import &#123; DomSanitizer, SafeHtml &#125; from '@angular/platform-browser';
import &#123; productLD &#125; from '../product';

@Component(&#123;
    selector: 'app-my-json-ld',
    template: '&lt;div [innerHTML]="html">&lt;/div>',
    styles: []
&#125;)
export class MyJsonLdComponent implements OnInit &#123;
    itemLD = productLD;
    html: SafeHtml;
    constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) &#123; &#125;
    ngOnInit() &#123;
        this.html = this.getSafeHTML(this.itemLD);
    &#125;
    getSafeHTML(jsonLD: &#123;[key: string]: any&#125;): SafeHtml &#123;
        const json = jsonLD ? JSON.stringify(jsonLD, null, 2).replace(/<\\/script>/g, '<\\\\/script>') : '';
        // escape / to prevent script tag in JSON
        const html = `&lt;script type="application/ld+json">$&#123;json&#125;&lt;/script>`;
        return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(html);
    &#125;
&#125;</pre>
    <p>Another option of implementing JSON-LD format in your project is to insert <a
            href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-lite/json-ld"
            data-rt-link-type="external">@ngx-lite/json-ld</a> component created by <a
            href="https://twitter.com/coryrylan" data-rt-link-type="external">Cory Rylan</a>, Google Developer
        Expert for Angular and Web.</p>
    <h3>Building Structured data<br></h3>
    <p>So, applying Structure data format
        is all about achieving a user-friendly data view in search results - less but well-structured info is better
        than presenting all the available details.<br></p>
    <p>Here's an example of the well-structured snippet for
        product details:</p>
    <pre>
export const productLD = &#123;

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>SEO and
        SPAs aren't good friends. Web applications built on JavaScript platforms perform worse in Google search
        results than websites delivering plain HTML to the crawler.&nbsp <br></p>
    <p>So if you're building a
        JavaScript app, you'll need to help Google on ranking your site. Be sure to consider SSR and Structured data
        formatting to adapt the result view of the site for different types of projects. Also, Structured data
        formatting influences the search engine's understanding of content, therefore, it can help with relevance
        signals. Besides, Google provides tools to test your results.&nbsp <br></p>
    <p>We showed the example of
        building an Angular product description template according to Structured data principles. Go ahead and try
        more rich snippets to represent features like articles or job postings.&nbsp <br></p>
    <p>We hope this helps
        you build SEO-friendly Angular apps! :) If you have already implemented structured data, we'd love to hear
        your feedback.<br></p>
