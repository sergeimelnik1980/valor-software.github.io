    <p>Let’s take a closer look at the personalities of this cooperation, from not just a professional, but a personal
        angle. One of&nbsp;<strong>Zack Jackson’s</strong>&nbsp;biggest goals, inspirations, and drivers for life is his
        willingness to improve the developer experience. Being a person who invented Module Federation he has indeed
        revolutionized the way of architecturing software. This methodology is now being adopted across the ecosystem by
        organizations such as SAP and Google. Zack lives by the challenge that “nothing is impossible”! He’s started
        living this challenge since his childhood in South Africa, where he managed to master programming despite the 2G
        capability networks and other limitations. This gave him great empathy for users with low/no connectivity and
        lower-powered devices.<br></p>
    <p>Alongside a great passion for authoring code which he started at the age of 13. Zack finds joy and inspiration in
        active leisure, riding his snowmobile, and going camping. Between cats and dogs, he’s definitely a dog person
        and is the proud owner of a couple of French bulldogs.</p>

    <p><strong>Dmitriy Shekhovtsov </strong>describes himself as a JavaScript (NodeJS + Angular) addict and Software
        architecture maniac. Being a person of a rather critical and rebellious nature, when working as an architect at
        software development entities, he always noticed the procedural and communication flaws of most organizations.
        Feeling there was a way of building and running the company more efficiently, Dmitriy organized Valor Software.
        He’s managed to switch from the heartless format of IT manufacture to a living, vibrant, flat-structured
        environment for engineers to offer bold and nonstandard ideas to realize clients’ vision and goals most smartly.
    </p>
    <p>Passionate about open-source, Dmitriy has built Valor Software utilizing open-source technologies and
        contributing back to the community with numerous open code libraries.</p>
    <p>Dmitry is also a dog person, and not just a lover of his own pets, he sponsors and assists a local pet shelter,
        with dozens of cats and dogs that needed financial support and additionally gave a safe home to three cats who
        reside in our Kharkiv office. Between discussions and action, Dmitriy chooses action. Additionally, to unwind he
        goes to play computer games, MMORPGs are his favourite. Last but not least Dmitriy is a family guy and loves to
        spend time with his kids! :)</p><h4><strong>Why this partnership is important</strong></h4>
    <p>In the fast-paced business environment, scalability is vital to succeeding as you can react to newly arisen
        market and user demands instantly. Businesses can reach better scalability by splitting huge monolithic products
        into smaller independently-manageable applications handled by isolated teams (free to take their own technical
        decisions and make separate deployments). And Module Federation, as the continuation of the scalability
        philosophy, allows to expose applications, particular functions, components, or contents and reuse them between
        other apps.</p>
    <p>No matter how massive your system is, MF will eventually allow you to deploy changes to all the applications in
        one click without touching the codebase. <em>“I want universally uncoordinated, uncontrolled orchestration of
            distributed code at runtime. That’s my ultimate goal!” </em>– says Zack Jackson, describing the future he
        sees for Module Federation. Among the primary objectives for this cooperation is building the ecosystem for
        Module Federation and strengthening it as a backend technology.</p>
    <p>For companies in time-pressured industries, moving from a monolith to the architecture of independent services
        powered by Module Federation would mean ​​indisputable competitive advantage. And collaboration between Zack
        Jackson and Valor Software allows for joint effort in increasing MF availability for business.</p><h4><strong>In
        conclusion</strong></h4>
    <p>Module Federation, a game-changer in JavaScript architecture, has boldly entered the market and been adopted by
        the ecosystems of giants like SAP and Google. Despite this fact, it’s still on the way to reaching the peak of
        success. We're looking forward to the breakthroughs in deployments and sharing dependencies coming from the
        ambitious cooperation that made a reason for this publication!</p>
