  "seoDescription": "While working on a 10million plus user meditation app, I ran into a very weird issue. Looking into the file format, I found it is an mp3. There are many ways to seek within an audio file. Want to seek 6.3 seconds in a 100 kbps file? – Jump to the 630kb position. Should be somewhat accurate, but a 10s+ difference seems a bit too much. Let's analyze the file precisely, then – visit a marvelous world of VBR, also known as Variable Bit Rate, and play a guessing game. Finally, I'll mention a couple of solutions, to work with mp3 with less headache or to find an elegant alternative.",
