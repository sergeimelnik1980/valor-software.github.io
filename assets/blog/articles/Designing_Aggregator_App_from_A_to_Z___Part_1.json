So, you need to use several\n    apps in parallel, you lose time comparing movie sessions and prices to make the right choice. My task was to fix\n    this and make this movie escape easy and convenient. I thought of one and only app that would display all the movie\n    places and movies available. It would also allow for picking the movie from all the possible options in the city and\n    purchasing them online.<br>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    In this article, I'll share how to design an app and lead you through every stage from user research to mock-up.\n    Learn how to gather the information you need and create a splashing design based on users' pains and preferences.\n    And, good luck with your beginnings :)<br>\n    </p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:1600px\">\n    <div>\n        <img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/60a4c6a92141388b7d2d9fe1_rOQ11ZZYkhE9Vg2brc3x94XaGdOQOuxUr6UbDK_Q2_RGn3JMBmOr_xGuJ6P2qaFQUh09hjAIfy8V9cs9NuBontVyETUHEFCY7Vnlaj5_Xd5pIrzmtDIUQRDVQxDm5U3uVyvn5V_o.png\"\n        width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    </figure>\n    <h2>\n        <strong>Stage 1: Designing the product<br></strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n    I attended the <a href=\" https://ux-clan.org/training/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Product Design</a> course, and\n    my graduation task was to develop a mobile app that would merge all the movie places of all the biggest Ukrainian\n    cities.

Before the pandemic,\n        he attended movies from time to time with his family and friends.\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n    <p>He's driven by the opportunity to rest from work and experience positive emotions.&nbsp Daniil loves watching\n        films on a big screen.</p>\n    <p><strong>How he picks movies and buys tickets</strong></p>\n    <p>He checks the title and the cover, reads the description, and watches the trailer. The latter uncovers about 50%\n        of the plot, Daniil says.&nbsp Then, he considers the feedback from the audience online. For picking films and\n        purchasing tickets he goes with a <a href=\" https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD/id757872310\"\n        target=\"_blank\">Vkino</a> app.<br></p>\n    <p><strong>Suggestions on how to improve the service</strong></p>\n    <p>1. Add locations of the movies to the app to ease the choice for visitors.<br></p>\n    <p>2. Add maps to build a route from the visitor's locations to the movie place.&nbsp <br></p>\n    <p>3. Improve an online seats map to clearly show where the screen is.<br></p>\n    <p>4. Connect the app to Apple and Google Pay to ease the purchase process.<br><br></p>\n    <p><strong>Interviewee 2</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sophia&nbsp </p>\n    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 35</p>\n    <p>'<strong>How often does she go to the movies</strong></p>\n    <p>Sophia never attended the movies since the pandemic, and she's not really a huge fan.</p>\n    <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n    <p>Spending time with her dear people, especially with the nephew who loves cartoons. Sophia prefers impressive\n        special effects on a big screen and watching films right after the release.<br></p>\n    <p><strong>How she picks movies and buys tickets</strong>'</p>\n    <p>She checks the trailer on the movies' website or just somewhere on the Internet,&nbsp then вЂ” buys tickets\n        from the official website. Sophia generally finds it convenient unless they have troubles with the website (when\n        it doesn't work for a few days). Then she books tickets through the phone and then purchases them at the\n        movies. She doesn't use apps because that's her partner's prerogative.<br></p>\n    <p><strong>Suggestions on how to improve the service</strong></p>\n    <p>1. Create one and only app that would give information about every single movie place in the city, also вЂ” allow\n        booking and purchasing tickets.<br></p>\n    <p>2. Make it possible to purchase tickets through Apple and Google Pay with no need to add users' data every\n        time.<br></p>\n    <p>3. Make fewer registration steps on the way to the purchase.<br></p>\n    <p>4. Provide an opportunity to buy popcorn and sodas through the app and pick them up at the movies with no queues\n        (we could use a barcode or something like this for payment confirmation).<br><br></p>\n    <p><strong>Interviewee 3</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Mariia&nbsp&nbsp </p>\n    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 20</p>\n    <p>'<strong>How often does she go to the movies</strong></p>\n    <p>She's been to the movies a couple of times because of the pandemic. Before she used to go there monthly.</p>\n    <p>'<strong>Motivation</strong>'<br></p>\n    <p> It's a nice way to have fun and relax with friends.&nbsp <br></p>\n    <p><strong>How she picks movies and buys tickets</strong></p>\n    <p>She usually checks the trailer, searches for ads about the film, and considers her friends' feedback. Before\n        she used <a href=\" https://multiplex.ua/cinema/kharkiv/dafi\" target=\"_blank\">Multiplex</a> to pick a movie\n        and purchase tickets as she used to live right next to this movie place. Now she lives downtown and prefers the\n        Planeta Kino&nbsp app. It provides a user-friendly interface, a great variety of films, and an Apple pay payment\n        method.&nbsp </p>\n    <p>She's frustrated because it takes time and effort to switch seats when you book tickets online. After the choice\n        is made, she has to wait for 15-20 minutes till her previous order gets canceled. And someone can book the seats\n        she wants while she's waiting.<br></p>\n    <p><strong>Suggestions on how to improve the service</strong><br>- Organise the catalogue of films the way we can\n        see several options on one screen at once, this speeds up the search. Planeta Kino offers horizontal scrolling\n        and shows just one film on a mobile screen.</p>\n    <p>- Offer an easy way to change the booked seats for other ones before the purchase.<br></p>\n    <h3>3. Field research<br></h3>\n    <p>To feel the frustration users tend to feel while using apps, I communicated with them and tried myself in the\n        role of a user. I visited 2 movie places in my city, Planeta Kino and Multiplex. This way, I was able to observe\n        the visitors, their behavior in front of the checkout, the ticket purchase process, the cashier's behavior, also\n        the tech they're using to provide a better service.<br></p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:900px\">\n    <div>\n        <img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/60a4c6a95a35bad1845e403e_kdcxokWRD4f4YwSbFnLVZMI6DhlJPVz6eM_XM_bAZ6lJ5CUW0QlLoT9tCvayHYHmP5aojg8FXIKQCfuIAa-QFt-nwIWGPCEHRCoH5PGDNwaVdZ99HcCUKiE_JPrfwE0nLkTa0OjF.png\"\n        width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    </figure>\n    <p>I also got myself involved in this process by becoming a customer, I put myself in their shoes, and this helped\n        me experience their journey.

Sure\n        thing, the friend agreed :-)</p>\n    <p>Alexander reached for his phone to find tickets online through the app. He checked the posters of the movies\n        playing that day, and the new Justice League caught his eye. He watched the trailer, checked the movie story,\n        and decided to go for it. He chose a movie place that was closest and a suitable session, picked seats for two,\n        and paid for the tickets. Then, he checked the tickets', added them to 'Wallet' for quick and easy access,\n        and closed the app. Finally, time to get ready for the show!<br></p>\n    <p>After a while, Alexander and his friend met at the movies and joined the line to enter the movie hall. Alexander\n        prepared the tickets for scanning in the \"Wallet\". After the check, they took their seats and started watching\n        the movie. BTW, it was a good piece.

Alexander was on a lunch break, discussing the upcoming Justice League, which had\n        been added to the future release at the movies. Everyone was looking forward to seeing it. The only way to get\n        tickets for the premiere was to pre-order them online. He picked up his phone, downloaded the application,\n        opened it, skipped the registration, and in no time found the movie he was seeking. He selected the movie place,\n        session, and seats. Before he had a chance to pay for the tickets, the App asked for mandatory registration to\n        complete the purchase. He's registered in one tap with his Apple account. After the registration, he paid for\n        the tickets, checked the ticket details, and closed the application.&nbsp </p>\n    <p>In three weeks, on the movie premiere day, Alexander and his friend met at the movies and stood in line in front\n        of the entrance to the movie hall. Alexander opened the application, went to the 'Tickets' section, and\n        prepared the tickets for scanning.<br></p>\n    <p>After check-in, they entered the movie hall, took their seats, and started watching the movie. Alexander liked\n        the movie very much. After watching, he received a notification from the App asking him to rate the movie.
