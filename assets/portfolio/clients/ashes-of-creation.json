    "Intrepid Studios, authors of the most anticipated MMORPG – Ashes of Creation, inspire unity and bring people together through the game. Avoiding pay-to-win or cash grab elements, they simply create games the way people want them to be, with great respect and devotion to the community.",
    "“I want to see the players dictate the direction of our story. I want to see the AoC world adapts and reacts to the player’s actions. Most importantly, I want to see a game built by gamers FOR gamers.” – says Steven Sharif, the Creative Director of Ashes of Creation, describing what stands behind the idea of AoC.",
    "Ashes of Creation hasn’t just offered a beautiful fantasy world with over 100 locations but redefined the MMORPG genre giving the community the power to participate in the direction of the world's development and influence literally every aspect of the game. However the Ashes of Creation universe is more than just the game client, it also needs a great website for people to discover the game, dive deeper into the lore, meet the community and pick up the latest merch. This is the direction where Valor’s team had a big time of success."

  "challenge": [
    "Ashes of Creation has a huge number of fans, and we wanted to ensure they get incredible experience not just with the game, but the website around Ashes of Creation. The existing solution couldn’t meet the company’s goals for growth and represent the brand properly after it matured. We helped Ashes of Creation address their community’s willingness to connect, purchase merch and cosmetics and launched a new website that can grow together with the brand.",
    "Also, as AoC has matured, the technologies and services they've been using have naturally evolved. Some are no longer supported, and some became too expensive or irrelevant for the company. From this occurs the second part of our mission – to refactor the codebase, remove expired services, and optimize the number of servers used, correspondingly – the budget associated with maintenance."
