                    <b>While meditation remains complicated, time and sacred knowledge-requiring activity in the
                        majority
                        of minds, Breethe proves it can be easy to meditate.</b> The app helps people to make relaxation
                    and
                    awareness part of their lives without any sacrifice. Charismatic and easy-going creators made
                    Breethe for our good, thinking of humans and hoping to make a session with Breethe our favorite part

                    Our customers have already achieved huge success with the Breethe app for iOS-powered devices when
                    they turned to Valor for building the version for Android. Our main challenge with this project was
                    to deliver the first version of the app within the limited time, and later – to completely replicate
                    the design and the functional scope of the iOS app, which had been on the market already for a
                    while.

            Sleep tracks, hypnotherapy sessions, masterclasses, music, and nature sounds playlists are just a few of
            the numerous things you can find in Breethe. To simplify the development, management, and scaling of the
            app, Valor suggested using NativeScript to build a single code base that would equally support iOS and
            Android versions.

                of Breethe in the future. Our current goal is to align Android functionality with the iOS application,
                which
                has been worked on for much longer than the Android app. We’ll keep you posted on the progress, and try
                to
                enjoy sleep and deep relaxation in-between :)
