We used the Amazon Athena to query data from the data lake and analyze it. Since Amazon Athena still gives out data in a “raw” format, we added a PostgreSQL database to the reporting pipeline using Ruby for the reports’ backend logic. This backend solution helps organize data, structure it, and bring it to the format suitable for reports. What’s more, it gives an opportunity for caching.']
